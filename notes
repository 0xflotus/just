clean up export parsing

- raw strings with ''
- multi line strings (not in recipe interpolations)
- indentation or slash for line continuation in plain recipes

- allow calling recipes in a justfile in a different directory:
  . just ../foo  # ../justfile:foo
  . just xyz/foo # xyz/justfile:foo
  . just xyz/    # xyz/justfile:DEFAULT
  . path prefix is starting dir, so just ../foo can run ../../justfile:foo
  . how does this interact with a=b/hello?

- change name back to 'just', suggest j as alias

- readme:
  . start with an example justfile
  . make it clear it's beta, mention that, as a command runner
    there is probably a higher than normal chance of disaster
  . installation instructions
  . long guide
  . talk about all command line flags
  . vim and emacs syntax hilighting (use makefile syntax hilighting for now)
  . `` strips a single newline
  . habit of using clever commands and writing little scripts
  . alias .j='just --justfile ~/.justfile --working-directory ~'
  . very low friction to write a script (no new file, chmod, add to rcs)
  . note that shell is invoked with -u
  . users can email me for help
  . make list of contributors, include travis
  . ask users to contribute their justfiles as tests
  . please open an issue for feature requests

- big example justfile
  . justfile.example
  . lots of comments
  . parse them
  . update tarball dep
  . check version string
  . clean
  . update logs (repetitive git flow)
  . quine

- rewrite grammar.txt

- try to get some users
  . travis
  . recurse center
  . facebook friends
  . irc
  . r/rust
