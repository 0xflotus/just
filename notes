notes
-----

- arguments:
  . change evaluate_expression to evaluate_lines
  . fast errors when arguments are not passed
  . don't assume that argument count is correct
  . don't unwrap errors in evaluate line
  . sub arguments into recipes

- save result of commands in variables: `hello`

- set variables from the command line: j --set build linux


- before release:

- rewrite grammar.txt
- start with an example justfile
- then installation instructions
- then a long guide
- make it clear it's beta, mention that, as a command runner
  there is probably a higher than normal chance of disaster
- change name back to 'just', suggest j as alias
- change description to "a polyglot command runner"?
- update readme
- document all code, including private stuff
  (can this be enforced with a lint?)
  #![deny(missing_docs)]
- note that shell is invoked with -cu, explain -c and -u
- document all features with example justfiles
  (also make them runnable as tests)
  . update tarball dep
  . check version string
  . clean
  . update logs (repetitive git flow)
- full documentation
  . talk about why the syntax is so unforgiving
    easier to accept a program that you once rejected than to
    no longer accept a program or change its meaning
  . habit of using clever commands and writing little scripts
  . very low friction to write a script (no new file, chmod, add to rcs)
  . make list of contributors, include travis
  . alias .j='just --justfile ~/.justfile --working-directory ~'
  . lay out the structure of the code, mention tests, give tips
    for contributing
- vim and emacs syntax hilighting (use makefile syntax hilighting for now)
- make sure there isn't any unused code
- ask users to contribute their justfiles as tests
- try to get some users
  . facebook friends
  . irc
  . r/rust

enhancements:

- colored error messages
- multi line strings (maybe not in recipe interpolations)
- raw strings with ''
- iteration: {{x for x in y}}
- allow calling recipes in a justfile in a different directory:
  . just ../foo  # ../justfile:foo
  . just xyz/foo # xyz/justfile:foo
  . just xyz/    # xyz/justfile:DEFAULT
- allow setting and exporting environment variables
- indentation or slash for line continuation in plain recipes
